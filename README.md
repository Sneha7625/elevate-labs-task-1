# Java Console Calculator

## ðŸ“Œ Task
**Task 1:** Build a basic calculator using Java console I/O.
## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Create a simple calculator program in Java that performs basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using terminal input/output.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Java (JDK)
- VS Code
- Terminal / Command Prompt

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure
Javacalculator/
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ Calculator.java
â””â”€â”€README.md


## âœ… What I Did
1. Created a main folder named `Javacalculator`.
2. Inside it, created a `src` folder to hold source code files.
3. Added a Java file named `Calculator.java` inside `src`.
4. Wrote Java code implementing:
   - Methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - `Scanner` to read user input.
   - A loop to allow multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit.
5. Compiled and ran the program using terminal.
6. Tested all operations for correct output.

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcome
- Practiced Java syntax, console input/output, methods, and control flow.
- Understood how to organize Java projects with packages and proper file structure.

## ðŸ“‚ Deliverables
- `Calculator.java` (Java source code file)
